##### Contour:  Outline of something. 

# Getting Started

So this project will give you a hands-on on major tasks done in image processing. I'll walk you through all the function which are used in the code. 

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming skills in python or any another language. This is written in python.
- OpenCV V.2.0+
- Python 2.7+ or Python 3.5+.

## Some of the additional libraries that are required: 
1. Numpy: Strictly for fast computations.
2. OS : for making command line calls.

### The functions used are from the the official [OpenCV Documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/imgproc.html)

##### 1. cvtColor(x,y)
Used to convert one form an image to another form. [Official documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/miscellaneous_transformations.html#cv.CvtColor).
